# Sampling Assignment Discussion
## Creating samples:
### In total of 5 samples of size 385 are created using sampling the following sampling techniques-
1. Simple Random Sampling
2. Systematic Sampling
3. Cluster Sampling
4. Bootstrap Sampling
5. Stratified Sampling
## Model Selection
### The following classification models have been employed :-
1. Logistic Regression
2. Gaussian Naive Bayes
3. SVM
4. Decision Trees
5. Random forest classifier

### Following are the accuracy scores for the models for each sample-
|          | Model 1 | Model 2 | Model 3 | Model 4 | Model 5 |
| ------   | ------ | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Sample 1 | 0.89   | 0.88  | 0.83  |   0.96   |    0.99    |
| Sample 2 | 0.59   | 0.69  | 0.68  |   0.80   |    0.97    |
| Sample 3 | 0.97   | 0.98  | 0.95  |   0.96   |    0.99    |
| Sample 4 | 0.94   | 0.98  | 0.96  |   0.98   |    0.99    |
| Sample 5 | 0.97   | 1     | 0.98  |   1      |    0.99    |
